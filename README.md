## Note on AI Integration
This project was designed to integrate with paid AI inference APIs (OpenAI / HuggingFace).
Due to the absence of API credits, live AI generation is not enabled.

However, the full frontend, API routing logic, and error-handling flow are implemented to demonstrate real-world integration readiness.
