# AI Prompt Demo

## Overview
This project is a simple full-stack web application that demonstrates an AI-style prompt and response workflow. The application allows users to enter a prompt in the UI, sends it to a backend API, and displays a generated response.

The focus of this project is to showcase full-stack integration, API design, and an AI-driven interaction flow.

## Features
- Prompt-based user interaction
- Clean and minimal UI
- Backend API route handling requests
- Modular inference layer
- End-to-end working flow

---

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- React
- API Routes (Node.js runtime)

## AI Integration Note
Due to the absence of access to paid AI APIs during development, this project uses a deterministic local inference layer to simulate AI responses. The backend logic is intentionally designed in a modular way so that the inference layer can be easily replaced with real AI providers such as OpenAI, Hugging Face, or other LLM services without changing the frontend or API contract.

This approach ensures the application demonstrates a complete AI-style workflow while remaining cost-free.
